# Daily Commit Python Script 🐍

This Python script automates the process of making daily commits to a Git repository. It appends the current date to a `README.md` file, creates a commit with a randomly generated message, and pushes the changes to a remote repository. 🚀

## Prerequisites 📋

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** 🐍: The script requires Python 3.
- **GitPython** 📦: A Python library used to interact with Git repositories.

You can install GitPython using pip:

```bash
pip install gitpython
```

## Configuration ⚙️

1. **Create a Configuration File** 📝

   Copy the provided `config.template.json` file to `config.json`:

     ```bash
     cp config.template.json config.json
     ```

2. **Edit the Configuration File** ✏️

   Open `config.json` in a text editor and modify the fields as needed:

   ```json
   {
       "repo_path": "/path/to/your/repository",
       "readme_path": "README.md",
       "commit_prefix": "Daily update 🌟:"
   }
   ```

   - `repo_path`: The path to your Git repository on your local machine.
   - `readme_path`: The path to the `README.md` file within your repository.
   - `commit_prefix`: A prefix for your commit message.

## Script Overview 🛠️

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Load Configuration** 📂: Reads the `config.json` file to get repository details.
2. **Generate Commit Message** 🎨: Chooses a random animal and gemstone to include in the commit message.
3. **Append to README.md** 📄: Adds the current date and time to the `README.md` file.
4. **Create Commit** 🗃️: Stages the changes and creates a commit with a message.
5. **Push Changes** ⬆️: Pushes the commit to the remote repository.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository** (if you haven’t already) 📥:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Warckoooooo/daily-commit-python.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory** 🌍:

     ```bash
     cd daily-commit-python
     ```

3. **Run the Script** ▶️:

     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

   The script will automatically make a commit and push it to the remote repository based on the configuration provided.

## Setting Up a Scheduled Task or Cron Job ⏰

### Windows 🖥️

To automate the execution of the script daily on Windows, you can use Task Scheduler.

1. **Open Task Scheduler** 🔍

   Search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu and open it.

2. **Create a Basic Task** 🛠️

   - Click on "Create Basic Task" in the Actions pane.
   - Provide a name and description for your task.
   - Choose "Daily" for the trigger and set the desired time.
   - Select "Start a program" and browse to the Python executable (`python.exe`), typically located at `C:\PythonXX\python.exe`.
   - In the "Add arguments" field, enter the full path to your script, for example: `"C:\path\to\daily-commit-python\main.py"`.
   - Finish the setup and ensure the task is enabled.

3. **Verify the Task** ✅

   Make sure the task is listed and enabled in Task Scheduler. You can run it manually to test if it works correctly.

### Linux 🐧

To automate the execution of the script daily on Linux, you can set up a cron job.

1. **Open the Crontab Configuration** ✏️

   Edit your crontab file using the following command:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add a Cron Job Entry** 🕒

   Add the following line to schedule the script to run daily at a specific time (e.g., 2:00 AM):

   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/daily-commit-python/main.py >> /path/to/daily-commit-python/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

   - Replace `/path/to/daily-commit-python/main.py` with the full path to your `main.py` script.
   - The `>> /path/to/daily-commit-python/cron.log 2>&1` part redirects the script’s output and errors to a log file (`cron.log`), which you can check for troubleshooting.

3. **Save and Exit** 💾

   Save the changes and exit the editor. The cron job is now scheduled to run daily at the specified time.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Authentication Issues** 🔑: Ensure you have set up the remote URL with the correct credentials or token. Refer to GitHub's documentation on Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for more details.
- **File Paths** 🗂️: Verify that the `repo_path` and `readme_path` in `config.json` are correct and point to the appropriate locations.
- **Dependencies** 📦: Make sure all required Python libraries are installed.
- **Scheduled Task / Cron Job Issues** 📜: Check the respective logs (`cron.log` for Linux, Task Scheduler history for Windows) for any errors or messages.
